# XBMC4Gamers

### Damn nice front end for Games using XBMC

 This is a pet project of mine and its a combination of a skin, python scripts and source edits to XBMC.

 The main objective of this project was to allow my kids to use the same Xbox but also have there own saves, so to stop fighting lol. Now the original Xbox doesn't allow this by default, so I had to think outside of the box and learn and create some Python script to do the job. It works quite well.

 Now since the above, I have added scripts that fixes scrambled screen games on v.1.6 Xbox ( 480p video mode ) clean save directories of blank saves, clean program thumbnails or refresh them as well as others to do other tasks. It's a jack of all trades lol.
